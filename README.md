# DiceGame
Focus on good OOP principles

Small project.

Did not worry about input.

Focus:
  - use of const
  - use of pointers
  - ensuring no additional copies of objects created at any scope
  
Rules of game:

  - Player scores 1 point if both dices match
  - Player loses 5 points if two 1's are rolled
  - Player score doubles if they roll two 6's and his score is positive
  - Game Never Ends unless you want it to :)
